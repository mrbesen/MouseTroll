# MouseTroll
A little Programm, that spinn your mouse coursor.
The Arduino version is for [this](http://digistump.com/products/1) USB-Stick.

To stop the Java version, just move your mouse to the top left corner and then down to the bottom right within 5 seconds
(should work for multi-screen-setup, but no warranty.)
To stop the Arduino version just unplug the device or constantly reset the processor of the device (not the computer!!!).

###### Have a nice and funny troll

I take no warranty for anything!
