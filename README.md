# MouseTroll
A little Programm, that spinn your mouse coursor.
There is an Arduino Digispark version for [this](http://digistump.com/products/1) USB-Stick planed.

To stop the Java version, just move your mouse to the top left corner and then down to the bottom right within 5 seconds
(should work for multi-screen-setup, but no warranty.)

###### Have a nice, funny troll
